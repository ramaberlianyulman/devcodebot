## Troubleshooting

Ensure your TikTok account is public and use a valid video link (e.g., `https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNVTS1eE/`). Copy links from the TikTok app or website. For view errors, try airplane mode to refresh connection or check Zefoy server status. Login issues may stem from captchas or Cloudflare protection. Expect 1000+ views in 4-10 minutes, but busy servers may reduce delivery. View drops may result from TikTok’s security, Zefoy bugs, or platform issues.
